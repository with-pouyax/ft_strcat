# ft_strcat

This repository is dedicated to the `ft_strcat` function, a custom implementation designed to concatenate two strings. The function appends the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the terminating null byte (`\0`) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte.

## Function Overview

The `ft_strcat` function combines two strings by appending the source string (`src`) to the destination string (`dest`), ensuring that the resulting string is properly null-terminated. This function is useful for merging strings in a controlled manner, especially when working with buffers or constructing strings dynamically.
